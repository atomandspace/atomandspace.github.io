## VISHAL SINGH
I'm an [Engine Management System](http://www.autotap.com/techlibrary/intro_to_engine_management.asp) Calibration expert based in Pune, India. I'm a Mechanical Engineering Post-Graduate from IIT Guwahati. Engineering has been a sub-conscious part of my life (I've broken more things than I've built :P).

I work at Tata Motors Limited, Pune. [Engine Base calibration](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/engine-base-calibration-a-model-based-approach-for-the-air-charge-model-calibration-1525331994542.html), [Emission Calibration](https://dieselnet.com/tech/engine_emission-control.php) and [OBD-Calibration](https://x-engineer.org/automotive-engineering/internal-combustion-engines/diagnostics/on-board-diagnostics-obd-modes-operation-diagnostic-services/) are area of my expertise. I'm a huge fan of using technology for improving quality of work. Apart from calibration work, I have developed several [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme/) based applications for reducing human effort in calibration data analytics. I love participating in data analysis competitions to learn new methods and showcase myskills.
