## VISHAL SINGH
I'm an [Engine Management System](http://www.autotap.com/techlibrary/intro_to_engine_management.asp) Calibration expert based in Pune, India. I have worked on Spark-Ignition-Engine's [Base calibration](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/engine-base-calibration-a-model-based-approach-for-the-air-charge-model-calibration-1525331994542.html), [Emission Calibration](https://dieselnet.com/tech/engine_emission-control.php) and [OBD-Calibration](https://x-engineer.org/automotive-engineering/internal-combustion-engines/diagnostics/on-board-diagnostics-obd-modes-operation-diagnostic-services/). I'm a huge fan of using python for improving productivity in routine calibration task. I have developed several [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme/) based applications for reducing human effort in calibration data analytics
